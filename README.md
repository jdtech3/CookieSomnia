## CookieSomnia

Minecraft server plugin that allows eating of cookies to reset insomnia.

Idea from [a Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/wj6n2r/comment/ijg826x/) by /u/wayward_dad:
> Eating cookies resets insomnia, allowing you to avoid phantoms without sleeping (and resetting your spawn location).

Tested on [Purpur 1.19](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur).
